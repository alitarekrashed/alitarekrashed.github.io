title: Week Eight

Class was a little slower this past week. We introduced our next project, a large project (taking up the rest of the semester),
that's divided up into three stages. We're building an IMDB-like database for a topic of our own choosing, working in groups
of 5. This project involves using a ton of different tools, but overall it seems like it'll be a great learning experience. I 
met with my group, and we divided up the work and have started making progress towards finishing 'stage 1', which is due this 
coming Thursday. We've still got a bit of work to do, but I'm confident that we'll be able to finish in time.

I've been working on the frontend, which is something I don't have any real experience in. We haven't made a ton of progress,
but getting a navigation bar to show up was very rewarding. I'm looking forward to diving into the rest of the project.

I've got a couple tests this week that have been eating up my time, which makes juggling this project, and those tests, a little
challenging. It feels like I never have enough time to do everything that I'd like to do. By tomorrow afternoon, I should have
quite a bit of free-time ahead of me, and I'm planning on throwing myself onto the rest of this project.


##### Tip of the Week
[Dependency Injection](http://martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html) was something that I wasn't really familiar with
until this summer. This is a good article that explains its benefits.

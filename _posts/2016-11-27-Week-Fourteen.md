This is the last post I'll be making on this blog. It's crazy how fast the semester flew by, and I can't believe that I'll be graduating
in less than a week. 

We only had one class last week, due to Thanksgiving break, and we talked about design patterns. It was an interesting lecture, and design 
patterns are highly relevant in the tech industry, so it was useful was well. I definitely need to find some time this week to go back
over the files and study the patterns in greater depth to fully understand them, but this was defintiely a good introduction to them.

This upcoming week we've got our presentations for our IDB project, as well as our second (and final!) test in this class. I've still
got to meet with my group to decide how we want to divvy up the presenting, and if we need to make any edits to our presentation. I've
also got to start studying for our test, I'd wanted to get a lot done over the break, but I didn't get around to it, so this week
will be quite busy. I've got another test on the same day, and another programming project due in another class. It'll all be over soon,
but I don't think I'll have much free-time until Thursday evening.

Overall, this class has been very valuable, and I've learned a lot over the course of the semester. It was hard work, but I think the
most valuable classes usually are.

##### Tip of the Week
I find that I'm usually more productive when I'm checking stuff off of a to-do list. [Wunderlist](https://www.wunderlist.com/) is a 
great tool to use.

This week in class we started to talk about SQL queries. I took Data Management a year ago, and have done some database work in a past
internship, so I'm pretty comfortable with querying in general. That said, some of the stuff we've gone over in class involve keywords
I'm not familiar with, so I feel like I'm learning a bit of new information from the lectures. Similarly to when we went over XML/JSON though,
there's a ton of stuff to keep track of, and sometimes it can feel like a lot of noise. I need to go over the code on github and try and 
pull out the important pieces of information sometime in the next week.

We also turned in the second phase of our project. I stuck to frontend work for this phase as well, and it definitely went smoother than 
the last phase. I'm sure I'm not following a lot of the best practices for frontend work, but I'm comfortable enough now with AngularJS that
building pagination for our tables, as well as a modal for the unit tests came pretty easily to me. I also reworked some of our HTML/CSS for
our other pages to improve the design. That probably has to be my least favorite part of frontend development, but practice has been helping.

We've got one last phase of the project left. We're going to need to implement another group's API, as well as adding search functionality to
our site. I don't imagine too much trouble getting that stuff working on the frontend side, though the backend for search might be more
involved. I'd like to use some of my freetime to refactor some of the javascript, and see if I can extract common functionality into a service
or something, it could be a good learning opportunity.

##### Tip of the Week
I'm starting to look into ways to unit test AngularJS. [Here's the official documentation](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/unit-testing)

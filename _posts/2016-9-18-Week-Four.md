title: Week Four
---

I've spent the last week working on the Netflix project. My partner and I met a few times to work on it, and have pretty much 
wrapped it up at this point. Initially, we tried to create a cache for the actual values of all the training data, to calculate
the RMSE, but the file was prohibitively large. Eventually, we settled on the idea of only caching the actual values for the
ratings in the probe.txt file, but at that point, another student had already created and posted that cache to the public 
directory. After we were able to read the caches using the hardcoded pathname, the rest of the project was straightfoward. In 
class, we had a speaker from Bloomberg come talk about his experience with the company and the tools he uses on a regular basis.
I was familiar with some of the tools he mentioned (I used JIRA this summer), but others were new to me. He also talked about
keeping up-to-date on new technologies. Overall, it was a valuable experience.

This week, we'll probably work a little bit more on the project, tidying up the code, and maybe writing a few extra tests. That
said, it's good to not have the threat of a deadline looming over us. I'm also going to try and get better about doing the 
readings that are assigned for this class. I've been slacking, and it's definitely reflecting in our in-class quizzes. Outside of
this class, I've got a couple tests this week, as well as another project in a different CS class. For the most part, however, 
I'm staying ahead of my work, and I hope to keep it that way.

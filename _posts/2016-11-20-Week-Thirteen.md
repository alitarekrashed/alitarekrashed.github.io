title: Week Thirteen

This past week we turned in the third, and final, phase of the IDB project. That means the only assignments left in this class are a 
couple in class quizzes, and then our second test. I figure this is a good moment to reflect on the IDB project as a whole, and my
experience with it. I wasn't wholly unfamiliar with web development before this class, but I had minimal experience with Python, and no
real frontend experience at all. I'd say that this project has taught me a lot, and that I'm grateful for all that I've learned. I've 
still got a long way to go, but I'm definitely a lot more comfortable now than I was a month or two ago. 

There are some things that I think went really well in this project. The features we had to develop for our website were interesting, and
enabled us to explore different approaches that we could take. I think the emphasis on using Github, continuous integration, issue tracking,
and Slack was very beneficial, and even though I'd had experience with all those tools before, more experience never hurt anyone. The 
feedback we receieved for phases one and two was clear, and gave us items to improve upon for subsequent phases (e.g. in the second phase,
some of our feedback mentioned that our splash page was a little too bland, and that we should put a background image on it). The feedback
was helpful, and let us iterate on our design using someone else's perspective.

A few things could've gone better. I think my team struggled with communication sometimes, and it was hard for us to meet in person. As a 
result, some things that could've been resolved quickly took a little bit longer than it should've. There was always a last-minute rush 
before the submission to make sure everything was in order, and that could've been avoided by aiming to finish all of the development by
Wednesday night, instead of Thursday afternoon. I think we definitely got better about all of this from phase to phase, but we never
really solved any of these problems, we just got better at handling them. I think my team could've also shared knowledge a little more. 
None of us had frontend experience, and I think it would've been good for me to carve out time to explain the things I'd learned to 
other members of the team who were also working on the frontend.

All in all, it's been a valuable experience. The things that could've gone better provides a good opportunity to identify my own 
weaknesses so I can (hopefully) keep improving. I'm glad that I took this class.

It's crazy to think that this next week is Thanksgiving, and that in a couple weeks, I'll be graduating. It's weird to think about, so
I've kind of been ignoring it. Because of Thanksgiving however, we'll only have one class this next week. I'm hoping to be able to carve
out sometime during the break to get a headstart on studying for our last test. There's a lot I need to revise.


##### Tip of the Week
Interviewing season might be behind us, but for those who are going to be job hunting in the Spring, here's a nice little 
[Big O Cheatsheet](http://bigocheatsheet.com/). In the past, I've found it helpful in reviewing data structures and sorting algorithms.

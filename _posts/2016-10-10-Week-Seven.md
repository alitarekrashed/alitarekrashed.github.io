This past week had a lecture and our first exam. In lecture, we talked about decorators, another feature of Python I don't have any
experience in. After lecture, I think I've got a decent handle on it, but I still need to mess aroudn with them. It's a cool feature,
and I'm deifnitely appreciating Python more and more as this class goes on. 

We also had our first exam. I prepared for the class by creating the notesheet to bring to the test, as well as catching up on the relevant
readings from the textbook. I hadn't been keeping up with the readings before this, but I found them useful when reviewing for the exam. I
was familiar with some of the concepts from previous internships, but I still gained a lot from the readings. The exam itself was fair,
and we had plenty of time to do it. I won't know how well I did until we get our scores back, which will hopefully be soon.

The spec for the new project was posted today, so I need to review it this week. It's a 5 person group project, so it should be an interesting
project at the very least. I've also got a couple other tests for other classes of mine coming up, so I'll be spending most of this next
week juggling studying for those, while staying on top of the rest of my work.

##### Tip of the Week
Here's a [post about Python decorators](http://thecodeship.com/patterns/guide-to-python-function-decorators/), I've found it helpful.

title: Week Twelve

I spent some time this past week working on the last phase of the IDB project. For this phase we've got to get search functionality working,
as well as use another team's API in an interesting way. I've been tackling the frontend stuff for search, but also got the opportunity
to our unit tests for our search endpoint. We're using pytest as our unit testing framework, and I'd never worked in it before, so it was
nice to be exposed to it. We've also had to come up with user stories that we need to refine and estimate as part of this phase. It seems
a little weird to have to do user stories at this point. We've been using Github Issues to track what we need to do, and it seems like we 
would've benefited more from writing user stories in the first or second phase of the project. Regardless, I'm looking forward to wrapping
up this last phase of the project, so I can turn my attention to studying for Test 2.

In class we finished up our talks about SQL and then moved onto refactoring. I definitely learned some new stuff about SQL that I didn't 
know before, but I'm curious to see how all the data-related stuff we talked about will show up on the test, since we've spent so much
lecture time talking about it. Maybe we'll have to write SQL queries or a JSON schema? I'll have to remember to pay attention to that
when it comwes time to start preparing for the test.

Next week, I'll be focusing my attention on finishing up the IDB project and preparing for the presentation. We also had questions over
the reading for the first time in a while so I should probably catch up, I sorta forgot about the readings after the first test.

##### Tip of the Week
[Pytest](http://doc.pytest.org/en/latest/) is a pretty powerful framework for unit testing.

title: Week Five
---

This past week the Netflix project was due. My partner and I finished it a couple days before the deadline, so the week wasn't too
stressful. It was a straightforward project, but testing was a little weird. We had a couple functions where testing made sense, but 
the rest of the tests felt unnecessary, though we wrote them to hit the 3 tests per function guideline. Writing good tests is important
though, and when we refactored some functions, having the unit tests helped us ensure we didn't accidentally break everything. I also had
two exams and another project this past week. I managed to stay on top of my work, so while it was busy, it wasn't too hectic. 

In class, we had a guest lecture from a NASA employee. He talked about his work on an augmented reality project involving the Mars rover,
and we got to play around with the application on a HoloLens for a bit. It was a cool experience, and the talk was very interesting. He
discussed a lot of the tools his team uses, as well as their practices. I particularly liked when he talked about their style of 
brainstorming: having everyone write their ideas on sticky notes and place them on walls, and then discuss them. Overall, it was another
good talk about the industry. I'm not sure how many more of these lectures we can expect, but I'm looking forward to them.

This upcoming week, I'm planning on beginning to prepare for our first exam. I'm not entirely sure what I should expect, though I'm hoping
that'll be clarified in class. Regardless, I'm going to go over the code samples we've been talking about in class, to make sure I've got
a good understanding of the concepts we've covered. In particular, I'll implement some of the functions we've  written in class (i.e.
Factorial, Reduce, Map, etc.), based on the provided unit tests. I think I'll find myself spending quite a bit of time in the Python
interpreter, trying out different things to cement some of the details we've talked about.

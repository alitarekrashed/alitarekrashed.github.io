title: Week Three
---

This week, the Collatz project was due. I finished the project a few days before the due date, so it wasn't too stressful. I got an email
the day the project was due, requesting that I uncomment some lines in the makefile, but that was a quick change. I also caught a couple
small mistakes (I had forgotten to copy the output of the unit tests to the output file), but those were quick fixes. Finishing the
project early definitely had value, since it gave me time to look over my submission and make sure that everything was in order.

The lectures this week were informative and easy to follow. I appreciate that we're taking time to go over different elements of Python
as a programming language. I like working in Python and I think I'll be a lot more proficient with the language after taking this class.

We've got a new project this coming week. I haven't looked at the spec yet, though we're supposed to go over it in class on Tuesday. 
Ideally, I'd find a partner and start working on it sooner rather than later. I've got projects and tests coming up in other classes, and
getting a head start on this project will make the next couple weeks a lot less stressful. I'm also reminding myself that test 1 will roll
at the start of October, so it doesn't end up sneaking up on me.

##### Tip of the Week
Recruiting season is starting to pick up. [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) is a good resource if you're practicing for tech 
interviews.

title: Week Two
---

This past week was our second week of classes, and the semester is now in full swing. Unrelated to school, I also accepted a
full-time offer, and I'm very excited. It's a relief to not having to worry about interview prep or job hunting. 

Regarding class, we spent this past week discussing a couple different things. We talked about some arithmetic optimizations
that can be used to solve the Collatz problem, and we learned some things about Python (specifically exception handling and the range
object). I have enough experience with Python that the code during the lectures has been easy to follow so far, but there 
are enough gaps in my knowledge that I've been learning a lot about some of the different aspects of the language.

Outside of the lectures, I've been working on the Collatz project. I started early, implementing the simple solution (no cache).
That was straightforward, but I hit a couple roadblocks when I was trying to get Sphere to accept it. I kept getting a timeout
error, and I spent a lot more time than I would've liked trying to debug it. After several hours of debugging and refactoring,
I realized that when I wasn't actually updating the cache when I tried to eagerly calculate some of the values. On the bright 
side, Sphere's finally happy with my solution.

Next week, I'm planning on finishing up the rest of the Collatz project (generating acceptance tests and documentation). The first
test in this class is coming up in a month, and I'm not too sure what to expect. My goal is to try and stay on top of the 
material we cover in lecture, so I'm not playing catchup before the test.

##### Tip of the Week
I have a really bad habit of forgetting to check which branch I'm on before committing my changes. [git-prompt](https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/contrib/completion/git-prompt.sh) 
displays your git repo's branch in your bash prompt. It can help you keep track of which branch you're working on.
